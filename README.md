## Required libraries

If you don't have Python on your computer, you can use the Anaconda Python distribution to install most of the Python packages you need. Anaconda provides a simple double-click installer for your convenience.

This notebook uses several Python packages that come standard with the Anaconda Python distribution. The primary libraries that we'll be using are:

1) NumPy: Provides a fast numerical array structure and helper functions.
2) pandas: Provides a DataFrame structure to store data in memory and work with it easily and efficiently.
3) matplotlib: Basic plotting library in Python; most other Python plotting libraries are built on top of it.
4) Seaborn: Advanced statistical plotting library.
