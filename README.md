# Fifa-DataAnalysis
Analysis Fifa Data along with various constraints.

## Introduction
FIFA is one of the most popular football simulation video games of all times. I am sure that not only me but most of the people (I guess the majority would be males) probably played this game once in their life. Especially if you are a football fan, then you played this game not only once. I, as a football fan, have played FIFAâ€™s series for a long period of time, especially during my school years, and never got bored. 

## Required libraries

If you don't have Python on your computer, you can use the Anaconda Python distribution to install most of the Python packages you need. Anaconda provides a simple double-click installer for your convenience.

This notebook uses several Python packages that come standard with the Anaconda Python distribution. The primary libraries that we'll be using are:

1) NumPy: Provides a fast numerical array structure and helper functions.
2) pandas: Provides a DataFrame structure to store data in memory and work with it easily and efficiently.
3) matplotlib: Basic plotting library in Python; most other Python plotting libraries are built on top of it.
4) Seaborn: Advanced statistical plotting library.

## Conclusions
I hope you found this example notebook useful for your own work and learned at least one new trick by reading through it.
